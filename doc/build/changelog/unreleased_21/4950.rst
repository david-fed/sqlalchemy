    Added support for the SQL ``CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`` construct via the
    new :class:`_schema.CreateTableAs` DDL construct and the
    :meth:`_sql.Select.into` method. The new construct allows creating a
    table directly from the results of a SELECT statement, with support for
    options such as ``TEMPORARY`` and ``IF NOT EXISTS`` where supported by the
    target database.  Pull request courtesy Greg Jarzab.
